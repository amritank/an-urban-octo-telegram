#  HTML/CSS Code Optimization

## Description

This project includes the refactored HTML/CSS code. The changes included:
- updating the index.html file to use semantic HTML tags
- consolidating redundant CSS styles
- ensuring the header tags appeared sequentially in the html page
- adding the alt attribute to all the img tags

As part of this excercise I learned to apply the HTML and CSS knowlege I have gained so far to make the page responsive.
